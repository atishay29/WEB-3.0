QUESTION :- Is loaning system i implemented centralised or decentralised? Point out demerits of a centralized system.

MY ANSWER :- LOANING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED BY ME IS A CENTRALISED SYSTEM. 

DISADVANTAGES OF CENTRALIZED SYSTEM :
1. AS THEIR ARE LIMITED NUMBER OF SERVERS IN CENTRALISED SYSTEM THEREFORE IT CAN CRASH OR SLOW DOWN SOMETIME WHEN IT IS OVERLOADED. 

2. DICTATORIAL : CENTRALISED MAY NOT ALWAYS BE IN THE INTEREST OF MAJORITY BUT WILL ALWAYS BE IN INTEREST OF 
THE LEADER OR OWNER OF THE SYSTEM.

3. IF MAIN SERVER FAILS THEN YOU MAY DATA , UNLIKE IN CASE OF DECENTRASED SYSTEM WHERE COPY OF WHOLE DATA IS SPREAD ACCROSE THE NETOWRD.

4. AS THEIR IS ONLY SINGLE SERVER IT VERY DIFFICULT TO TAKE SERVER DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE.
